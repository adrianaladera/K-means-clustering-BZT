# K-means-clustering-BZT
Public access repository for scientists and curious people alike! Use k-means clustering to determine the phase transitions in barium zirconate supercells with 5% Zr concentration (Ba(Ti0.95,Zr,0.05) <come back and check the concentrations later>
  
### Create the CSV datasets
1. The dipole pattern plotting files usually come in the format "Stripe*.plt", where * = [X, Y, Z] depending on whether a viewer wants to view the dipoles in the positive or negative direction with respect to the desired axis. You can use `test`
  
  2. 
  
  
### K-means clustering
  
### Cumulative variance, elbow methods, and cluster plots
  
### Visualizing dipole patterns
